factor
======

Small sample program to print a list of factors for an n-nomial equation. 

A friend asked me to give him a program that would print out the general solution for any n-nomial expansion of the form:

a*x^n + b*x^n-1... + n. I offered to let him put in the coeffienents and solve the equations, but all he wanted was the textual 
representation, so here it is! 

I've included a factorer.bat file and executable jar so you can run it. Just run factorer <n> where <n> is the number of factors.
